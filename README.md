# Aqw-UltraSpeaker-Visualizer
script to help people time their taunts / zone for ultraspeaker in aqw

# About
the script breaks down the ultraspeaker sheet in to 5 parts and highlights the listen/truth you need to taunt
it also tells who need to zone and highlights in red if its you
by clicking 'a' you can move to the next block (do upon red zones)

# What it can do
the scripts allows you to choose who's taunts you'll take charge off (in case you use a different way to kill him)
it also can help be the shot caller (the one who tells who to zone).
simply it was meant to make the sheet easier to look at (and smaller as its dynamically changes between blocks)

# Customizing
if you want to change the key the next block command is binded to. you can at line 24 in main.py

# Demo
